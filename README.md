# From Soybean Fields to Slaughter Markets: Uncovering the Hidden Connections in Beef Production
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This regression project will focus on total value of beef at slaughter market (measured in billions of dollars, based on data
from the    and the impact the following variables could have on annual production:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    • Average Temperature
    • Average Precipitation
    • Barley Production
    • Maize Production
    • Sorghum Production
    • Soya Beans Production
    • Cattle Population
    • Meat Consumption

I will begin with my hypotheses and a regression will run with all 8 variables and we will remove
insignificant variables manually one by one. Next, I will run the regression models again with associated interpretations of
the data. I will run the SPSS stepwise regression model, which will initially include all 8 variables so the software can
determine the most optimal regression model for what affects the total value of beef at the slaughter market. Lastly, I will
discuss the method of data collection, and any biases that may affect the individual variables, as well as the overall data
set. 

## Section I: Hypotheses and Rationale
_______________________________
In the following sections, I will test these hypotheses by running regression models, analyzing the results, and adjusting
the models accordingly.

    Of note, for interpretation purposes, my working statistical test hypotheses are as follows:
    • H0: the tested variables do not affect the total value of beef at the slaughter market.
    • H1: the tested variables do affect the total value of beef at the slaughter market.
