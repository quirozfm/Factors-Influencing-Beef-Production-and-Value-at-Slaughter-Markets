# From Soybean Fields to Slaughter Markets: Uncovering the Hidden Connections in Beef Production
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This regression project will focus on total value of beef at slaughter market (measured in billions of dollars, based on data
from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Agriculture Organization of Nations (FAO) from
2002-2021 and the impact the following variables could have on annual production:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    • Average Temperature
    • Average Precipitation
    • Barley Production
    • Maize Production
    • Sorghum Production
    • Soya Beans Production
    • Cattle Population
    • Meat Consumption

I will begin with my hypotheses and a regression will run with all 8 variables and we will remove
insignificant variables manually one by one. Next, I will run the regression models again with associated interpretations of
the data. I will run the SPSS stepwise regression model, which will initially include all 8 variables so the software can
determine the most optimal regression model for what affects the total value of beef at the slaughter market. Lastly, I will
discuss the method of data collection, and any biases that may affect the individual variables, as well as the overall data
set.
